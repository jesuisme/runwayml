# runwayml
Test of Model API from RunwayML

NOTE: An environment variable must be set for accessing hosted models. This module assumes a local .env in the root 
directory containing a token.

To use this code locally, replace "Add Your Token Here" with your RunwayML Bearer token in the .env file.

The .gitignore should leave your .env file out of commits, but check to be sure. Don't be like me and make commits 
with your token ;-)
